# Project1
My CS school/HEIs data management project using python programming including mysql, MS excel & plotting methods.

"Simplicity is never simple."

As seen in this project, the process of creating a user-friendly and straightforward platform that facilitates the administrator's job is one filled with complexities. The concepts learnt by me during my academic session were put into use in this project.
This project taught me a lot of imperatives about not only coding but learning as a whole.
